<p>We are living in a golden age of learning opportunities.  Massive Open Online Courses continue to lower the barriers to high-quality post-secondary education.  Vibrant open-source communities collaborate, engage, and create, disrupting traditional methods of teaching.  So does the web really need another how-to blog, another <em>look-at-me look-what-I-can-do</em> journal, another thinly-veiled ode to an engineer's ego?</p>

<p>No, it doesn't.  And this blog isn't meant for you.  It's another avenue on my own personal journey.  The very act of trying to teach others teaches myself.  So for these selfish reasons I started this blog.  To capture some of what I've learned from the fantastic people on Stack Overflow and Kaggle (to name just a few).  To bring back what I've found on so many trips down the rabbit hole.  And if someone somewhere happens to find something here that helps them on their own jouney, then bon voyage and godspeed to you.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>If you're still reading this, I'll vainly presume you're actually curious about me.  I'm the proud father to a lovely daughter, and together with my beautiful and patient wife, they fill my life with joy and laughter every day.  Both my career and my own passion for travel has let me experience Canada coast-to-coast, much of the US and Mexico, most of SE Asia, and parts of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.  A curious nature drives me to learn, to adventure, and to appreciate my short time on this planet.  So thanks for reading and enjoy your stay!</p>
