I'd like to add some **geospatial** information to our beer list so I can plan a pilgrimage to these fantastic breweries.  (Actually, we'll use this geospatial information in a future tutorial on visualization.)  Wikipedia's [List of Breweries in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breweries_in_Canada) is a fine place to start.  Let's go!"

    "Congratulations! After getting this far, you're now ready to wield the might of **Beautiful Soup** and **regex** to scrape web pages for data!  In our next tutorial, we'll focus on using *pandas* to clean our data.  Remember, our current dataframe contains the raw data from the wikipedia page, but it has some issues:\n",
    "- the `city` feature is a list object, and sometimes the list contains multiple entries (e.g. *Unibroue*)\n",
    "- some entries in `name` end with a comma (e.g. *Les 3 Brasseurs,*), so we should fix that\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's just from looking at the tail of our dataframe!  What other problems will we find?  Stay tuned and thanks for reading!\n",
