The first dataset is a list of the Top 100 Beers from Canada.  The second dataset is a list of all the breweries in Canada.  We'll find and fix some common problems when joining data.  In the next tutorial, we'll take the combined data and do some fun visualizations.  Ready?\n",

And `s1` and `s4`, with a ratio of 0.615, would have given us a **false positive** (e.g. it would have considered *Brasserie Dunham* as similar enough to *Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!*).  However, if we compare against the entire list of breweries, and take the highest ratio (if a ratio > 0.6 is found), then we can be reasonably confident a correct match was found.\n",
