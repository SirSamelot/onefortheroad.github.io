    "# Conclusion\n",
    "*pandas* and **SQLAlchemy** make it easy to work with databases.  You don't even need to write any SQL at all!  (Although I still recommend knowing *some* SQL due to its ubiquity.)  So can you completely rely on *pandas* and forget about SQL?  I would say no.  Both tools have their strengths, and the deciding factor has as much to do with your intended application as it does with your comfort level using the tool.  So as always, keep trying, breaking, and fixing. Thanks for reading!\n",
