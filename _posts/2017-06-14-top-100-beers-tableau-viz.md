**Tableau** is my go-to for interactive visualizations after cleaning data in Python.  Here's one I quickly put together using the [Top 100 Beers dataset]({% post_url 2017-05-16-merging-data %}) we created in an earlier tutorial.  Since I can't embed the viz in GitHub Pages, **click the screenshot below** to see the interactive viz hosted on Tableau.  Enjoy!

*Note that the viz is meant to be viewed at desktop size, not on a phone or tablet.*
